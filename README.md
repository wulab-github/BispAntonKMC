# BispAntonKMC
This program uses rigid-body-based Monte-Carlo simulations to study the binding kinetics of MHC/PD-L1 bispecific biologics
with membrane receptors TCR and PD-1 on the 2D cell surface. The rotational and translational variations derived from Anton2 all-atom
molecular dynamic simulations are used as input to regulate the conformational fluctuations of biologics in the Monte-Carlo simulations.

The input files are listed as follows:

    1: GS15_RtTotFl_ProbDistribution.dat
    
    2: GS15_TlTotFl_ProbDistribution.dat
